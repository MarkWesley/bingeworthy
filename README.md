# Bingeworthy

Welcome! Bingeworthy is a simple program that allows the user to find something great to watch on television. The user can search through a list of genres to find what they're looking for, then see a list of shows for that genre. From there, they can access an overview of each show. Happy binging!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bingeworthy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bingeworthy

## Usage

To use the program, run 'bin/bingeworthy' to get started. From there, follow the prompts in the CLI. To exit the program at any time, simply type 'exit'. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
